Hmmmm ok, everything's working fine on CAOS 4.2, running on CAOS 4.1
is broken in the game menu screen.

020B..04E8:     print intro screen

jump to 3ABF -> wait for key 0x0D (Enter)

3AC6:   set custom font tables
3AD8:   clear BF00 .. BFFF
3AE5:   copy 5 bytes from 3692 to 0051:
        08 09 0A 0B 20 
        (these are the control-key ASCII codes)
3AF0:   define some window rects
3B09:   copy 4 bytes from 3624 to B99C:
        00 00 28 20 
        (this is a fullscreen window rect)
        copy 6 bytes from 3644 to B9A0:
        00 00 00 07 37 F8
        ... copy 8x more such data sets to
        the area starting at B9A0...

3B25:   CALL 0CC0:

0CC0:   modify CTAB jumptable:
        copy to 0DC5, overwrite (0DE1) with 0CD6 (BEEP..??)

3B28:   CALL 1160: clear screen with color in A
        wait a little while (CALL F003 14)
3B33:   CALL 77E2 with A=0B

77E2:   no idea what's happening there, must be KC85/4 specific stuff
        since it's so close towards the end, there are also calls into 
        the 0x0900 area which seem to toggle pixel/color banks
        
3BA0:   JUNGLE intro screen done, waiting for any key

3BAC:   copy ROM area C000 into pixel memory to produce a noise background
        pattern, but on the the 85/4 C000 BASIC ROM is actually switched OFF!

        CALL 3853
3853:   draw top menu screen decoration (AKKU, ...)

3BD1:   draw menu screen usage instruction string

3BF4:   CALL 38CC with A=01

38CC:   select window and draw a BEEP (hey that's our custom function at 0CD6!)

0CD6:   hmm ok, the new BEEP handler seems to draw a window with border...

around 3C03:    draw topleft information window

3C33:   the following call to draw a string at 370D is broken!
        the string is the hardware and CAOS info, which seems to 
        confuse the SYSCALL 45...
        -> this works fine on CAOS 4.2
